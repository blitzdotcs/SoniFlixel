# SoniFlixel

* Basically a rewrite of ProjectCD but aimed to actually be worked on and finished.

* This is nowhere near finished so don't complain about anything, it's still in early development

# How to build

* Install Haxe and it's dependencies

* Install visual studio code (to edit the code unless you have notepad++)

* Install [Ogmo Editor 3](https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io/) (Unless you don't feel like editing the levels and making your own)

# Creds

* BlitzDotCS - Main Dev

* GallantGlobz - Tweaked Sonic Sprites
